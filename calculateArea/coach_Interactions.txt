Q1.1:
length = parseFloat(document.getElementById("length").value) 
Why do i need .value

A1.1:
the .value property is used to retrieve the value entered 
by the user in an input field. It is specifically used with 
HTML input elements like text fields, dropdowns, checkboxes, 
etc. For example, if you have an input field with the id "length", 
document.getElementById("length").value would give you the value 
entered by the user in that field.

Q1.2:
if the value is get from "document.getElementById("length").value" 
was already a float, parseFloat() would essentially do nothing? 
it would only make a difference if the number i got from 
"document.getElementById("length").value" was an integer?

A1.2:
Yes.
