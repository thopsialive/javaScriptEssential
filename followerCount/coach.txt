Q1: 
Why is it "if (count === 10){...}" and not "if (count == 10){...}", 
or even "if (count = 10){...}"?

A1: 
"if (count === 10)" uses the strict equality operator (===) 
which checks if the value of "count" is equal to 10 and also 
checks if the data types are the same. This means that both the 
value and the data type of "count" must be equal to 10 for the 
condition to be true.

"if (count == 10)" uses the loose equality operator (==) which 
also checks if the value of "count" is equal to 10, but it does 
not check the data types. This means that if "count" is a string 
with the value "10", the condition would still be true.

"if (count = 10)" uses the assignment operator (=) which assigns 
the value 10 to the variable "count". This is not a comparison, 
but rather a statement that assigns a value. So, the condition 
would always be true because the assignment operation returns the 
assigned value.
