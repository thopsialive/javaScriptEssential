Q1:
What is the difference between "submitButton.onclick = submitFeedback;"
and "submitButton.onclick = submitFeedback();"? Note second one 
starts the submitFeedback function before any data is collected, 
so before the button is even pushed.

A1:
"submitButton.onclick = submitFeedback;" assigns the function 
reference of "submitFeedback" to the onclick event handler of the 
submitButton. This means that when the button is clicked, the 
"submitFeedback" function will be executed.

"submitButton.onclick = submitFeedback();" assigns the result of 
the "submitFeedback" function to the onclick event handler of the 
submitButton. This means that when this line of code is executed, 
the "submitFeedback" function will be immediately invoked and its 
return value will be assigned to the onclick event handler. This 
is not desirable in most cases because it executes the function 
immediately, even before the button is clicked.

In general, when assigning a function to an event handler, you 
want to use the first syntax without parentheses 
("submitButton.onclick = submitFeedback;"). This way, the function 
will be executed only when the event (in this case, the button 
click) occurs.
