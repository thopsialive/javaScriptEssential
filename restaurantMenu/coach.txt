Q1:
What is map() and forEach()? How do these work for array 
iteration?

A1:
map(item, index, array)
The provided code converts breakfast menu array items into HTML 
strings using map() and an arrow function to structure each item's 
HTML format.

forEach(item, index, array)
The forEach method loops through each element in the 
mainCourseMenu array. For each item in the array, the arrow 
function (item, index) => {â€¦} is executed. Inside the arrow 
function, an HTML string is composed for each menu item, 
incorporating the item's content and its corresponding index.
