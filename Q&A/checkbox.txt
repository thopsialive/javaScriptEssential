Q1:
li.innerHTML = 
    `<input type="checkbox" id="task-${index}" 
    ${task.completed ? "checked" : ""}>`;

Can you explain what the "${task.completed? "checked":""}" 
part means?

A1:
Here's how it works:

*If task.completed is true, the expression evaluates to "checked", 
which means the checkbox will be checked.
*If task.completed is false, the expression evaluates to an empty 
string, which means the checkbox will not be checked.
